For the program to work, you need to get your own API Key from here:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start#get-a-key and paste it into the program.cs 84th line.
You also may need to change the directory of the txt file exported, also in program.cs.
The program starts by asking the user for longitude and latitude (I am not sure if I didn't mix the labels up, sorry).
After typing longitude and latitude, you have to close the window of the Form.
Then the longer you let the program run, the more background data it shall export to txt file.
The simulation is not exactly real-time - its velocity depends on your computer's parameters, internet connection etc.
For cleariness purposes, I decided to export just the citizens' status and positions in every interation of the simulation.
In one iteration, a citizen moves ca. 10 meters, and a citizen on a scooter moves about 10x faster.
If any issues should come up, please do contact me.
